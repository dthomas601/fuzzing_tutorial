# Software Vulnerabilities

Before exploiting a vulnerability, we have to have a clear understanding of what it is.

### What is a software vulnerability?

According to NIST, it is a security flaw, glitch, or weakness in software code that could be exploited by an attacker (threat source).

### Common Software Vulnerabilities

* Buffer Overflow
* String Vulnerabilities
* Unsigned Integer Wrapping
* Invalid-type conversion
* Read out of bounds
* Write out of bounds

### How can software vulnerabilities be used?


* Remote code execution – These vulnerabilities allow someone to execute malicious code on the victim's system.

* Denial of service – These vulnerabilities can allow someone to crash the software or entire system.

* Privilege Escalation – These vulnerabilities allow someone to escalate their privileges from a local account to an admin account.

* Broken authentication and identification theft - Vulnerabilities that allow an unauthorized system or information access

* Information leakage - Class of vulnerabilities that release information inadvertently from an information system.

* Etc.
