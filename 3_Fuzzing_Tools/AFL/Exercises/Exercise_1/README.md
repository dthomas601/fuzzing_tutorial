# Exercise 1: Search String (AFL++)

In this exercise use the fuzzing tools outlined previously to identify vulnerabilities in the source code provided.

In this portion of the assignment, we will provide different tasks that each student should complete. The answers are provided below, but the goal for the user should be to complete the activities without assistance. Only look at portions of the answers when all other alternatives have been exhausted.

## Sample input and output

Below are example inputs from the program being compiled normally with ```clang++```.

```
[afl++ e7b1c6fd0a5d] /src/fuzzing_tutorial/3_Exercises/Exercise_1 (main) # ./a.out
Enter the string that will be searched:
```

**Mary had a little lamb.**

```
Enter the character that is being searched for:
```

**a**

```
Length 23
Search char is 'a'
Checked string: Mary had a little lamb.
Chars count was: 4
```

## Task 1: Compile the files with AFL

Use the files provided in this section, ```string_search.cpp``` and ```checker.h``` , to create an executable binary with AFL.


<details>
<summary>Solution Task 1</summary>

Start by selecting a compiler to build the binary. The instructions are provided below:

```
afl-clang-lto++ -o searcher string_search.cpp
```

* -o searcher - This will create an executable named ```searcher```
* string_search.cpp - This is the C++ source file that is used to create the executable

This will create an instrumented executable to be fuzzed.

## Task 2: Create input seed values

Create at least one seed input file for AFL to mutate and use to fuzz the created executable. The input file should include two lines with the first being the string that should be searched and the second line containing the character to search for.

<details>

<summary> Solution Task 2 </summary>

There are multiple ways to create files that will be used as a seed value. In this example a folder ```in``` is created and we use the ```echo``` command to create these files.

```
mkdir in
```

```echo -e "Row Row Row your boat\no" > in/input1```

Second example is provide below as well:

```echo -e "jaielafilena0ofna;amfk\na" > in/input2```

To show these files, you can show something like the following:

```
cat in/*
```

</details>


## Task 3: Fuzz the executable with AFL

Take the resulting exeutable and fuzz it with the tool ```afl-fuzz```. Options for the tool can be found using ```afl-fuzz --help```.

<details>

<summary>Solution Task 3 </summary>

There are multiple ways of fuzzing this file.

An example of fuzzing an executable is shown below.

```
afl-fuzz -i afl_input -o output_AFL ./searcher
```

* -i - Input directory where new test cases will be saved
* -o - Output directory where the results from the fuzzing campaign will be saved

In this example the ```searcher``` binary is actively fuzzed to identify potential vulnerabiities.

AFL fuzzed the binary using the STDIN option. An example test case that could be provided is shown below:


test1
```
welcome to the real world
w
```

This ```test1``` testcase would be placed inside of the ```input``` folder before running AFL.

</details>


## Task 4: Check the crash inputs generated

The crashes generated should be saved to the path similar to ```output_AFL```. The full path will look like ```output_AFL/default/crashes/```.

With these inputs, the executable can then be tested to determine if the generated crash string is valid.

<details>

<summary>Solution Task 4 </summary>

An example test string that crashed this program is shown below:

```
NNSssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss��ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss����ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss����sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
```

Execute the ```searcher``` binary and provide this input (or the input generated by your fuzz campaign) to test if a crash occurs. Our example gets the following crash report:

```
[afl++ 5d7ea6d9cf96] /src/fuzzing_tutorial/3_Exercises/Exercise_1 (main) # ./searcher
Enter the string that will be searched:
NNSssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss��ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss����ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss����sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Enter the character that is being searched for:
s
Length 36
Search char is s
Checked string NNSssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss��ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss����ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss����sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Chars count was: 259
Segmentation fault
```
